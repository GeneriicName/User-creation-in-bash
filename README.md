# User-creation-in-bash

Users and Groups creation and management script i made with bash a while back, was made for fun. 

**I made it purely for fun, i did not use functions what so ever as at the time i did not know of their existence, the script is not very optimized**


## Features 
**Create users and groups, higly simplified**
